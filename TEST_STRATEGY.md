# Test Strategy — Numeo.ai_Abdul-ur-Rehman (Take Home Assignment)

## Project Overview
This document outlines the **test strategy** for the Numeo.ai take home assignment (Selenium + Pytest automation framework). The framework is designed to automate end-to-end testing for the SauceDemo web application, covering critical flows like login, inventory management, cart operations, and checkout.

---

## Test Objectives
- Ensure key functionality of the SauceDemo application works as expected.
- Validate login flows with multiple scenarios (valid, invalid, edge cases).
- Verify cart and checkout workflows.
- Demonstrate robust automation framework design using **Page Object Model (POM)**.
- Enable CI/CD integration with automated test execution.

---

## Test Scope

### In Scope
- User login flows
- Inventory/product operations
- Cart functionality
- Checkout process

### Out of Scope
- Performance testing
- API-level testing
- Cross-browser testing (currently Chrome only)
- Mobile device testing

---

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Login Tests
| Test Case | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Valid login | Verify user can log in with correct credentials (`standard_user`, `secret_sauce`). |
| Invalid login | Verify proper error message is displayed when using wrong username/password. |
| Empty username | Verify proper error message when username field is left empty. |
| Empty password | Verify proper error message when password field is left empty. |
| Logout | Verify user can log out successfully from the inventory page. |

### 2. Inventory / Product Tests
- Add products to cart
- Remove products from cart
- Verify product details and counts

### 3. Cart Tests
- Validate items added to cart
- Validate items removed from cart
- Verify subtotal and total prices

### 4. Checkout Tests
- Complete checkout process end-to-end
- Verify order summary and confirmation

---

## Test Approach

### Automation Approach
- Selenium WebDriver for browser automation
- Pytest framework for test management
- Page Object Model (POM) for reusable page interactions
- Fixtures for setup and teardown of WebDriver
- Headless Chrome mode supported for CI/CD

### Manual Validation
- Manual checks may be performed for UI validation if required

---

## Page Object Enhancements
- `LoginPage.get_error_message()` – Retrieves error messages displayed during login failures.
- `InventoryPage.logout()` – Handles logout functionality from the inventory page.
- Modular POM structure ensures maintainability and reusability.

---

## Test Data
- Predefined valid credentials: `standard_user` / `secret_sauce`
- Invalid credentials and empty field scenarios for negative testing

---

## Execution Notes
- Tests require a working internet connection to access SauceDemo.
- Headless execution enabled for CI/CD workflows.
- Test reports generated by Pytest in console output; can be extended to HTML reports.

---

## Reporting
- Pytest logs and assertions provide pass/fail status.
- Screenshots can be captured on failures for debugging (optional enhancement).

---

## Continuous Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow executes tests automatically on push.
- Headless Chrome ensures tests run without GUI for CI/CD.

---

## Risk & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Internet connectivity issues can cause WebDriver failures.  
  **Mitigation:** Ensure stable connection before execution. Consider adding retries or offline mocks if needed.

- **Risk:** Changes in SauceDemo UI can break locators.  
  **Mitigation:** Use robust locator strategies (ID, CSS selectors) and maintain POM regularly.
